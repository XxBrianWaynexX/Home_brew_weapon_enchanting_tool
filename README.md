Homebrew Weapon Enchanting Tool

This project is a fully customizable tool for creating and enchanting magical weapons in tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons 5e. The tool allows players and Dungeon Masters (DMs) to homebrew enchanted weapons with dynamic properties, manage risks during the crafting process, and add flavor to their campaigns.

Features

1. Weapon Selection

	•	Choose from a list of common weapon types (e.g., Longsword, Dagger, Greatsword) or input a custom weapon name.

2. Enchantment Properties

	•	Add attack bonuses (+1, +2, +3).
	•	Replace or add damage types (e.g., Fire, Radiant, Necrotic, Cold, Lightning, Force).
	•	Select multiple special effects, including:
	•	Foe Slayer: Extra damage to specific creature types.
	•	Combat Clairvoyance: Strategic advantage for one round.
	•	Vorpal: Decapitate on a critical hit.
	•	Speed: Grants an additional attack.
	•	Full list of effects is available in the dropdown.

3. Material Requirements

	•	Displays materials and their costs for each enchantment.
	•	Supports two modes:
	•	Material Questing: Players gather materials in-game.
	•	Gold Simplification: Pay a total gold cost to skip material collection.

4. Risk-Based Enchantment

	•	Crafting success is determined by:
	•	Weapon rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare).
	•	Character level and proficiency bonus.
	•	Outcomes include:
	•	Success: The weapon is enchanted as intended.
	•	Partial Success: The enchantment succeeds, but the weapon gains a random quirk.
	•	Failure: Materials are lost, and the enchantment fails.
	•	Catastrophic Failure: The weapon is destroyed or cursed.

5. Random Quirks and Curses

	•	Quirks (e.g., the weapon whispers faintly or glows intermittently) are added on partial success.
	•	Curses (e.g., the weapon harms its wielder or summons enemies) are added on catastrophic failures.

6. Experience Points (XP)

	•	Success and failure both grant XP based on the rarity and difficulty of the enchantment.
